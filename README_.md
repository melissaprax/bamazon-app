# bamazon-app

## Overview

This application is an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

## Walking Through The App

I used mySQL and Node.js to write this app. Additionally, inquirer and console.table NPM packages help with formatting and navigation through the Node terminal.
